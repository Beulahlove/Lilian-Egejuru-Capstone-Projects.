##Introduction
Over the past three months, I've immersed myself in a comprehensive Data Analysis & Visualization course. This intensive program has equipped me with cutting-edge skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visual storytelling.
Through hands-on projects analyzing real-world datasets, I've gained practical experience in transforming raw data into actionable insights. From global retail operations to local dining scenes and workplace dynamics, each project presented unique challenges and opportunities for growth.
